## Comments

1.  Tried pull the crawler logic out of the app however I ran out of time, so I couldn't.

2.  Sharp node for Mac is not compatible with linux version. So you should use docker for that.

3.  Spent 2 months to make an app and during the half of the time, I was refactoring it. TDD and clean code are the "most" important thing and always write clean code.

4.  Disparity between Dev and Prod environment bothered me most at the end of development.
    So I'll learn docker and docker-compose for future use.

5.  And finally, Keith Weaver's excellent guide to deploy MERN app to aws ec2 [link](https://medium.com/@Keithweaver_/setting-up-mern-stack-on-aws-ec2-6dc599be4737)
